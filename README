README for multi-UART test serTest
==================================

This utility forks 3 threads which in parallel send to multiple UARTS
and receives from them.

The UARTs are currently labelled and expected to be named
/dev/ttyS4 - /dev/ttyS11 (8 UARTs).

To be suitable for less UARTs defines in serialTest.c must be modified.


Compiling serTest:
------------------


cd into serialTest/ and call make.


usage:
------

just execute serTest as root:

~# ./serTest


then the program displays time and cycle count and behind every UART the nr. of milliseconds the select() call had to wait for the
sending UART to be ready.


TODO: 
- add option parsing to be able to set parameters during runtime
