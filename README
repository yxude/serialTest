README for multi-UART test serTest
==================================

This utility forks 3 threads which in parallel send to multiple UARTS
and receives from them.

The UARTs are currently labelled and expected to be named
/dev/ttyS4 - /dev/ttyS11 (8 UARTs).

To be suitable for less UARTs defines in serialTest.c must be modified.


Compiling serTest:
------------------


cd into serialTest/ and call make.
